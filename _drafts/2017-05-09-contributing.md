[Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org) is an open-source project and welcomes any and all contributions—everything from a small documentation fix to a significant new feature is appreciated.
It was created at the [Donnely Center](http://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and is under active development, coordinated through [Github](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js).

This guide is aimed primarily towards users without prior experience contributing to open-source software (OSS).
For contributors familiar with the process, the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file is a good place to read about Cytoscape.js-specific guidelines, such as code style.

## Why Contribute?

Cytoscape.js has a highly permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/blob/master/LICENSE), which allows users to modify the software as they see fit without requireing that they redistribute their changes.
However, contributing any changes back to the project are greatly appreciated, as this makes the software better for everyone.
Additionally, it means that your changes will be maintained as part of the project, making upgrading to newer versions of Cytoscape.js a lot easier—no more having to modify and rebuild the code for each release.
Plus, having your contributions in the main build of Cytoscape.js means you can take advantage of the various CDNs hosting builds of Cytoscape.js and save on bandwidth. 

## Discussing Contributions

Discussion for Cytoscape.js happens in a variety of places, among them [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cytoscape.js), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cytoscape/cytoscape.js), and GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/pulls) pages.
For code contributions, most discussion will probably occur on the pull request (PR) for that contribution.
We ask that discussions 1) are kept civil and 2) are kept helpful.

## Making a contribution

Contributing can be broken down into a series of steps:
1. Fork the project
2. Clone your fork
3. Make a new branch
4. Make changes
5. Commit and push changes
6. Create a pull request
7. Keep track of requested changes, etc.

### Forking and cloning

Steps 1-2 [are covered by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

In short, create a GitHub profile if you do not have one, [visit the GitHub page for Cytoscape.js](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js), click the Fork button, and clone your fork to download the code to your computer (using either the GitHub Desktop client or the command line).
