Cytoscape.js 3.17.0 has been released.  This release adds a `line-opacity` style property to set the opacity of an edge's line, i.e. independently from its label.

The full list of changes can be found in the [3.17.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/milestone/205?closed=1).

Thank you for using Cytoscape.js.
