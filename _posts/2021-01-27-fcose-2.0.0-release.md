fCoSE 2.0.0 has been released. This release
- adds support for user-specified placement constraints
- allows per-element values for some layout options
- fixes miscellaneous bugs

### Constraint support

fCoSE now supports user-defined placement constraints as well as its full support for compound graphs. 
These constraints may be defined for simple nodes. Supported constraint types are:

* **Fixed node constraint:** The user may provide *exact* desired positions for a set of nodes called *fixed nodes*.

</figure>

* **Alignment constraint:** This constraint aims to align two or more nodes (with respect to their centers) vertically or horizontally.

* **Relative placement constraint:** The user may constrain the position of a node relative to another node in either vertical or horizontal direction.

These constraints can also be added *incrementally* on a given layout while maintaining the user's *mental map*.

A demo page can be accessed [here](https://ivis-at-bilkent.github.io/cytoscape.js-fcose/demo/demo-constraint.html) to try out the layout interactively. 
A series of videos showing fCoSE layout in action is available in [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA9by_crwfaCK6gkAMIQ8OPp-k2NOi2H).

### Per-element values for layout options

fCoSE now also supports per-element values for ```nodeRepulsion```, ```idealEdgeLength``` and ```edgeElasticity``` options via functions. 
This feature gives more flexibility to the users while laying out their graphs.
