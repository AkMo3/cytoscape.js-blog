Cytoscape.js 3.16.0 has been released.  This release increases the speed of initially displaying the graph after creating a `new Cytoscape()` instance, especially for large graphs.  These changes may also improve general performance for several use cases.

The full list of changes can be found in the [3.16.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/milestone/201?closed=1).

Thank you for using Cytoscape.js.
