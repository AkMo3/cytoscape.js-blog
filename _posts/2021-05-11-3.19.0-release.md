Cytoscape.js 3.19.0 has been released.  This version adds support for events to differentiate between user-generated and programmer-generated zoom and pan gestures:

- `dragpan` : When a user pans by dragging the background
- `pinchzoom` : When a user zooms by a pinch gesture
- `scrollzoom` : When a user zooms by a scroll gesture (e.g. scroll wheel)

Big thanks go out to [Charles Stuart](https://github.com/charles-stuart-appdetex) for his contributions in this release!

The full list of changes can be found in the [3.19.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/milestone/214?closed=1).

Thank you for using Cytoscape.js.
