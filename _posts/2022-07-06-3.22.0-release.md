Cytoscape.js 3.22.0 has been released.  This version adds support for string stylesheet minification, by virtue of [support for omitting trailing semicolons in style blocks (#3031)](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/3031), as added by [Jason Via](https://github.com/VivaLaVia).

The full list of changes can be found in the [3.22.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/milestone/226?closed=1).
